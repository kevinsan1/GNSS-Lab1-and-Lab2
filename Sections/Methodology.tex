Describe the methods and instruments used to solve the problem. Matlab was used to solve the problem and used the GPS single point positioning algorithm.\cite{milanGPS} 

\noindent The steps from this algorithm are documented in the Matlab code, Section~\ref{sec:main_code}. The pseudo ranges and navigation messages are used to calculate a more precise position of the receiver.  The shift in position is a measure of the time for the signal to travel from satellite to receiver. 

This time traveled by the signal multiplied by the speed of light is the pseudo range.
