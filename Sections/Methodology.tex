Describe the methods and instruments used to solve the problem. Matlab was used to solve the problem and used the GPS single point positioning algorithm.\cite{milanGPS} 

\noindent The steps from this algorithm are documented in the Matlab code, Section~\ref{sec:main_code}. The pseudo ranges and navigation messages are used to calculate a more precise position of the receiver.  The shift in position is a measure of the time for the signal to travel from satellite to receiver. 

This time traveled by the signal multiplied by the speed of light is the pseudo range.  

All the satellites were used in this calculation in order to get the best possible approximation of the receiver coordinates.  Since we will be using least-squares method to solve for the parameters, the more independent equations we have, the better the approximation will be.
