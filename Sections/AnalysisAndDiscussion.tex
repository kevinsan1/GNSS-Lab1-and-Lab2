\section{Analysis and Discussion} % (fold)
\label{sec:analysis_and_discussion}
In this part you should discuss your results by, for example, considering the following questions:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Are the results reasonable? Compare the results with your expectations.
	Yes the results are reasonable.  The final position of the receiver is very close to the approximate position.


	
	The results are reasonable because the algorithm that we used only works if the approximate position is close to the solution.  The solution we calculated was 
	\item Can we draw any conclusion/implications from the results?
	\item Are results reliable and accurate?
	\item Would it have been more appropriate to use another method? Does the method need to be further developed?
	\item Etc.
\end{itemize}
